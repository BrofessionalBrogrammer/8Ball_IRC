Magic 8 Ball IRC Bot

To connect to the desired IRC channel, edit the ball-bot.py file,  It's very straightforward. Where it says "NICKHERE" or "PASSHERE" is where you enter such values. Once connected, you can call on the bot with '!ball', for example:

BrofessionalBrogrammer: !ball will I win the lottery tomorrow?

ball-bot: Outlook is good
